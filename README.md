Let's create a large Python module for a monster class act, along with its sub classes and super sub class acts
alike. The asterisk ( * ) imports EVERYTHING from within the variables_and_values.py Python file so you don't
have to worry about how many items from a file, or files you need to import into the Monster_Class_Acts.py Python
program file, which is this one here.
